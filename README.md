## 🖼️ AI vs Human-Generated Image Detection  
A deep learning model to classify AI-generated images vs. real images. This project was part of a **Kaggle competition**, developed in collaboration with [Youssif Emad](https://linkedin.com/in/youssifemad).  

### 📌 **Project Overview**  
This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to distinguish between real images and those generated by AI. We experimented with multiple architectures, including **ResNet, InceptionV3, and custom CNN models**, while optimizing for real-time inference.

### 🚀 **Features**  
✅ **Preprocessing**: Image resizing, augmentation, and Error Level Analysis (ELA).  
✅ **Deep Learning Models**: Implemented using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.  
✅ **Model Training**: Trained with **data augmentation** and **learning rate scheduling** for better generalization.  
✅ **Evaluation & Submission**: Metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall** were used to evaluate model performance.  

### 🔧 **Tech Stack**  
- **Python, TensorFlow, Keras**  
- **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib**  
- **Sklearn, PIL, OpenCV**  
- **Flask (for API deployment, optional)**  

### 📚 **Dataset**  
The dataset was provided by **Kaggle** and contains labeled images of AI-generated and real photographs. Data preprocessing involved **grayscale conversion, augmentation, and noise filtering**.
